The R贸kafog贸 game is inspired by chess, but a complete new conception.
### Starting position
![](readmeimgs/startpos.png)

We have a white pawn, which is the fox player, and we have a hunting dogs player who plays with black pawns.

The dogs can move diagonal only one step forward, and the fox can make the same moves as the dogs, but it can move backward too.

The main objective for the fox is to escape from the dogs, in other words go behind them. For example:

But hunting dogs player wins if they surround the fox, in other words they put in a certain position where the fox can't escape. For example:
